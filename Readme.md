# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 02: Gym Management Web Application HTML
We've written the HTML for the landing page (desktop size) that we'd designed a week ago, which is going to serve as structure to be stylize in future weeks.

So far, landing page has a responsive design with three sizes:

- ***Desktop:*** 1512x982 px
- ***Tablet:*** 834x1194 px
- ***SmartPhone:*** 390x844 px

So it's going to be used in every kind of devices.

You can find information about different services, buttons for ***Log In***, if you are member and ***Sign Up*** if you aren't part of the MegaRocket community yet, but you want to be.
