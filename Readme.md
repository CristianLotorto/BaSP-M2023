## Week 02: Gym Management Web Application HTML
We've written the HTML for the landing page (desktop size) that we'd designed a week ago, which is going to serve as structure to be stylize in future weeks.

So far, landing page has a responsive design with three sizes:

- ***Desktop:*** 1512x982 px
- ***Tablet:*** 834x1194 px
- ***SmartPhone:*** 390x844 px

So it's going to be used in every kind of devices.

You can find information about different services, buttons for ***Log In***, if you are member and ***Sign Up*** if you aren't part of the MegaRocket community yet, but you want to be.

## Week 03: Gym Management Web Application stylized with CSS

- We stylize the landing page (desktop size) with **CSS**, using **only**:

```
selector { 
    display: inline-box
}

selector {
    position: relative;
    top: X px;
    bottom: X px;
    left: X px;
    right: X px;
}

selector {
    float: left;
        or
    float: right;
}
```

for HTML elements **flow ordering**.

- Color palette is composed by:

```
    primary-dark: #373867;

    primary-light-green: #AACE9B;

    background-gray: #D9D9D9;

    background-navbar: #E5F2ED;

    background-navbar-links: #51A884;

    background-info-title: #88A47C;
```
 used mostly for **backgrounds** in specified sections of the landing page, 
 
 - and:

```
    text-light: #fff;

    text-dark: #000;
```
used for **font colors**. The main font-family used was **Roboto**.
